# FineTuning_DistillBERT

## Huggingface Natural Language Inference Task:
This task is taken from the Huggingface website (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/).

## Topics covered inside the project:
* Learning about the concepts of pre-training and fine-tuning
* Finetuning DistilBERT on the SNLI dataset which is a collection of 570k human-written English sentence pairs manually labeled for balanced classification with the labels entailment, contradiction, and neutral, supporting the task of natural language inference (NLI).
* Using your finetuned model for inference.
* Compare the model with the leaderboards top models to see how well it performs.
